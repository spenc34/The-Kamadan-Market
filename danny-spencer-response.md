# Prelude
Hey, Connor, this is Danny. I'm responding to your project description as an official request to join the team.

# Why I'm Interested
This project sounds cool. I've been interested in data science recently so I like the idea of gathering the different data on game prices and transactions and tracking those. I think we could store and display the data in cool ways that would be useful to other people. But even if no one else ends up using it, the problem is interesting and it will be fun to work on.

# How I'll Contribute 
I'll be able to help with everything. I'm doing the data science emphasis, so I will be able to asist in storing and analyzing the data. I also have experience with React and Node.js and Express, so I'll be able to work on both the frontend and the backend as needed.
